# Programming_Lab
 Programming Laboratory with C#

- Hello there. I will publish my C# notes and C# projects in this folder.
- In this folder, the subjects I learned from YouTube and the subjects I learned at university are included together.
- The reason I learned C# is that we used the C# language in the Programming Laboratory course we took in the spring semester of the second year of university.
